# IronFE
IronFE is a .NET library for parsing and extracting files. Its implementation focuses on a combination of video game file formats and generally old or obscure transport formats.

IronFE is currently under active development, without a solidified public API. Until initial development is completed and tested to a fair degree, the library will remain as [v0.0.0](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4).
